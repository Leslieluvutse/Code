                                    <p>I'm a Smart working engineering student specialized in Electronics and Communication Engineering.
                                        Along with my degree, I completed Python, SQL, Java, Cybersecurity courses and various technologies.
                                         What I learnt has helped me develop a project called "Drowsiness Detection & Alerting System".
                                        It was during this project that I discovered that I am a team player.
                                        I am currently seeking roles where I can utilize my experience and skill.<br>
                                        <br>
                                       
                                    </p>
